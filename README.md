- ðŸ‘‹ Currently I am assisting a local charity shop of an international charity organisation with some management tools. Y=This is exciting and rewarding work using LAMP, XAMPP, PHP, MySQL, MSSQL, PWA Docker to name a few of the tools. I have implemented a reconciliation and end of day application to monitor the daily existing POS system, added management reports and automated email notification. I have mod=st recently added a PWA Inventory scanning system to monitor stocks, Incorporating offline and batch funtions, it is used by floor staff at time of stock-up using smartphones which update the XAMPP MySQL database. 
-   I remain excited and motivated by the need for a treatment database for use by the behavioural and addiction therapeutic community.
- I have been involved in IT development and support for the past 30 years, and was fortunate to be able to use this experience volunteering at the South Coast Recovery Centre in KZN, South Africa from 2015 to 2020, where I designed and implemented an open source online application to capture and process patient treatment data. 
- I have used this experience to assist the Jahara Treatment Centre in Limpopo, South Africa from 2020 to present, in not only implementing their own open source on line Patient administration database, but converting their administration procedures to a paperless system. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Anything Open Source
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS, K8s
